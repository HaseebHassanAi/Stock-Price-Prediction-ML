# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the next day's closing price of a stock using multiple regression models. It covers the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, outlier removal, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and next-day prediction.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removes duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- **Outlier Removal**: Uses the IQR method to filter extreme values.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes numerical features for better model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- **Next-Day Prediction**: Predicts the next day's closing stock price using the latest available data.
- **Visualization**: Histograms and boxplots before and after outlier removal.
